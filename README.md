Installation/Startup Instructions:
    
* The first step is to download this directory from Github to a local directory on your computer.

* Open Terminal 

* Open the project directory and type: bundle install      -(This installs gems you need for the app)

* Make sure you have Postgres, if not download from the Postgres website. 

* Then, initiate a Postgres local server

* Open a new terminal tab and make sure you are not in Postgres or have a rails server open in that tab.

* Type: rails run rake db:migrate 
    -(this will migrate the app's tables)

* Type: rails server. 
    -(This will initiate your server)

* Open a new tab on your browser and type in localhost:3000
    -(If you get an error or a different application, make sure you do not have a previous local server running in a separate terminal tab.)

* Start using/updating the app to help pets and people in your area!
